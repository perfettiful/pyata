#summary if you want to start using Pyata, read this simple guide.

=Considerations=
Some stuff to have in mind before starting:
  # This library works *always* with pd in edit mode. So, if you don't want crash your program, don't change it.
  # Untill this version, it's *not recommended* to create two boxes too near (in x-y position) one from other. This is very important if you don't want to bug your program. This happens due to the manner Pyata was built, based on the position of the boxes on the patch that runs on Pd. I'm working to change this soon, but, till this, make sure to create boxes keeping a good distance between them.
  # The library is still in beta phase. So if you find an bug, please, report it.

=Still before starting...=
Before using, you have to install Pyata. You can find how to do it [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/How_To_Install here].

This tutorial is quite simple. it will create an oscilator ("osc~") and a digital-analogic converter ("dac~"), connecting them. The image above shows the final result. You can find further informations of classes, methods and what you can do with them reading the [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Pd Pd], [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Box Box], [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Object Object], [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Number Number], [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Message Message], [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Symbol Symbol], [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Comment Comment] and [http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Others Others], API specification.
